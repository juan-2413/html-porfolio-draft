<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>
  My name is Juan Cruz. I am 20 years old. My initial foray into programming dates back to 2022 when I completed a programming course 
  (focused on web development) called 'JÃ³venes a programar' (Youths Learning to Program). Since then, I have been dedicated to enhancing 
  my skills as a self-taught Front-end Web Developer through courses and project creation.

  Additionally, I am currently in my first year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Systems at ORT University to further advance my knowledge. 
  In my free time, I usually play the piano, listen to music of all kinds, read mathematics books, play video games, among other activities.
