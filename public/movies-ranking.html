<h1>The Bests Movies According to Juan Cruz</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>Epic and bloody battles. Good story.</p>
<h3>Hunger Games</h3>
<p>Great story, tension atmosphere and special effects. All-in-one.</p>
<h3>Terminator: Salvation</h3>
<p>I saw it in my childhood. It's clich√® at some point, but it has good special effects and excellent action scenes.</p>
